## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and NASA's API.

This project was written in JavaScript using the fetch method to access the NASA API. When a user enters a date in the appropriate format, the API return the NASA photo of the day. If the media file is a video, the video is displayed in the browser. This project was designed using CSS3.

## Lessons Learned:

This project furthered my understanding of APIs.
