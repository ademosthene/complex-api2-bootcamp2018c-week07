## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AudioDB and iTunes' APIs.

This project was written in JavaScript using the fetch method to access the iTunes API. When a user enters a an artist, the API returns the Artist music collections and prices. The AudioDB API then shares the artist information with the user, including a biography. This project was designed using CSS3.

## Lessons Learned:

This project furthered my understanding of APIs.
